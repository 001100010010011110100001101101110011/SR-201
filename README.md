# SR-201
Python code for SR-201 ethernet relay.

Eventualy this repository will contains working code to configure and control SR-201 Ethernet relay boards
My goal is to control this relay board through the OpenHAB 2.0 exec binding. 

Also see the following repository for more mature code:

# Openhab2 sample files.
Prerequisites
- [ ] Install Openhab 2
  - [ ] Install exec binding
  - [ ] Install base64 transform.

Copy the files and directories from this repo's `openhab2` folder into the openhab2 folder on your system. 
These examples assume relay-state.py is placed in the home of the openhab user so: `/home/openhab/relay-state.py`
